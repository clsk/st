Simple Statistical Language Compiler

This project compiles a simple statistical language created in a class environment as a proof of concept to C

Syntax:

python st.py <infile.st> [-o outfile.c]

Runtime Library files are located inside the out directory.
To create an executable, the resulting C file, together with the Runtime
library file code (vector.c) must be compiled into an executable.
